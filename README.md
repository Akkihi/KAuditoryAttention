**This game should solve the problem of auditory attention, perception and memory, developing it**

1) Make a prototype
2) I'm too lazy to think now, but there should be levels of complexity, for example: playback speed, second number of steps etc
3) It is also possible to make it so that there are two options 1) when the player himself presses the button and is ready to answer 2) the answer is accepted after some time (10 seconds)
4) You also need to use a variation of voices so that the progression goes not within one voice, but in different ones for the best effect.
